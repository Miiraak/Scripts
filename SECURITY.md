# Security Policy
This repository contains scripts and resources that are inherently powerful, and sometimes dangerous, by design.  
They are provided for educational, research, security, and learning purposes only.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
You are welcome to make vulnerabilities and security concerns **public** in this repository, **unless the issue involves private, sensitive, or confidential information**.  
If you find a vulnerability, dangerous behavior, or misuse potential, you may **open a public issue** so that everyone can be informed and discuss openly.

**However, please do NOT publicly disclose any problems involving private data, confidential information, secrets, or anything that, if published, could cause greater harm.**  
In such cases, report the issue privately to the maintainer, so it can be handled responsibly.

Alternatively, you can report privately at any time:
- **Contact:**  [miiraak@miiraak.ch](mailto://miiraak@miiraak.ch)

When reporting please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability or concern.
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Affected script(s) or folder(s).
- Suggestions for remediation or mitigation (optional).

## Dangerous Scripts & Intent
Many scripts in this repository can be dangerous or destructive if misused.  
They are **NOT** intended to target or harm any specific individual, organization, or system without explicit authorization.  
Scripts must **never** be designed to harm a precise person (physical or legal entity).

**Transparency:**  
Scripts must not attempt to harm the repository user in an obfuscated or misleading fashion .  
If a script is inherently dangerous (e.g., deletes system files), its purpose must be clear and documented.  
Misuse of such scripts is a user error, not a repository vulnerability.

## Supported Versions
- The repository is actively maintained.
- Scripts not in the [`Archive`](/Archive) folder are generally supported.
- By their nature, the majority of them will not receive security updates.

## Responsible Disclosure
We appreciate security research and discussion.  
Reporters of security issues (public or private) may be credited in [`CREDITS.md`](.CREDITS.md), unless anonymity is requested.

## Security Practices

- All scripts are for **educational and authorized use only**.
- Scripts are tested in controlled environments before publication.
- Contributors are encouraged to write clear code and document any security-relevant behavior.

If you have questions or concerns, please reach out via the contact information above **or open a public issue** if you believe it is in the best interest of the community, respecting the privacy guidelines above.
