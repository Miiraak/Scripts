# Scan-Own-Ports.ps1

## Overview
**Scan-Own-Ports.ps1** is a PowerShell script for Windows 10/11 that performs a comprehensive scan for open ports on the local machine using Nmap. If Nmap is not present, it will automatically download and install it from a custom repository. Scan results are saved to a report folder on the desktop.

## Features
- **Local Port Scanning:** Scans a specified port range (default: 1â€“1024) on your own machine (`localhost`).
- **Aggressive Nmap Scan:** Uses Nmap's aggressive scan flags for deep service and OS detection.
- **Automatic Nmap Setup:** Downloads and extracts Nmap from a custom repository if not already present.
- **Report Generation:** Stores scan results in XML, Nmap, and GNmap formats in a timestamped folder on your desktop.
- **Input Validation:** Checks for valid port ranges before running the scan.

## Requirements
- **Windows 10/11**
- **PowerShell 5.1+**
- **Internet connection** (for Nmap download if not present)
- **Permissions to create folders and files on the desktop**

## Parameters
| Name      | Type | Default | Description                          |
|-----------|------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| StartPort | int  | 1       | First port in the scan range         |
| EndPort   | int  | 1024    | Last port in the scan range          |

## Usage
### Basic Example
```powershell
.\Scan-Own-Ports.ps1
```

### Custom Port Range
```powershell
.\Scan-Own-Ports.ps1 -StartPort 80 -EndPort 443
```

## Script Workflow
1. **Validate Input:** Checks port range values.
2. **Ensure Nmap:** Downloads and extracts Nmap if not found in the script's `nmap` subfolder.
3. **Prepare Report Directory:** Creates a timestamped folder on the desktop for scan results.
4. **Run Scan:** Executes Nmap with aggressive options and outputs results in XML, Nmap, and GNmap formats.
5. **Success/Error Reporting:** Displays the location of the scan report or an error message if the scan fails.

## Output
- **Scan Reports:** XML, Nmap, and GNmap files in a folder named `NmapReports\<timestamp>` on your desktop.

## Help & Documentation
You can get help directly in PowerShell using:

```powershell
Get-Help .\Scan-Own-Ports.ps1
```

or

```powershell
man .\Scan-Own-Ports.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have an internet connection for the first run (for Nmap download).
- If you see `[ERROR] Invalid port range specified.`, double-check your `StartPort` and `EndPort`.
- Run as administrator if you encounter permission issues.
